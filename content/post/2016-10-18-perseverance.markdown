Another week begins. I was far, _far_ too excited about my Texans coming back to beat the Colts last night to actually write anything, so here we go. Just when you count them out they come back and surprise you. They persevere. I mean, take a look at this:

Statistically speaking, we had **at best** a 1% chance of winning at that point in the game. Makes sense when you’re down two scores going into the final five minutes, after all - I mean, there’s a reason people are calling it, alternatively, the comeback or the collapse of the year, depending on who you root for. And, well, if you follow the NFL _at all_, you know what happened by now.

I swear, I have some weird amnesiac voodoo … _thing_ going on with football this year. Every UTSA game I’ve forgotten we were playing ended up a win - including Rice deciding to not go for two this weekend. I turned the game off last night at the half, and, well, look what happened.

I did make it to church yesterday after all - the one that was easier to drive to even though it is a little further away, if you’re curious. Aside from being beyond stuffy and quite a bit smaller than I was expecting, it was nice to go. Sermon was nothing special, but in my mind that’s not the most important thing anyway. If there was one thing that _did_ stick out in my mind, it’s that the congregation seemed perhaps overly friendly. That was honestly a shock to me. I mean, I could get used to it after a while, but I can safely say I’ve never been _anywhere_ with that kind of atmosphere - not even at a My Little Pony convention, for that matter!

Later on I drove back by the one I was anxious about driving to based on my dry run. I think I can actually do it after all now that I know exactly what I’m looking for. It’s still a little nerve-wracking, but not as much as I had originally thought. Perhaps I’ll try over there next weekend.

Just found out tonight that I got a 76.5% on the forensics exam. Disappointing, but my average stays in the 90s (somehow) so I am okay with it. Furthermore, I’m above the average score. I’ll take it. I’ll bloody well take it. Ironically enough, I seem to have gotten most of the particularly hard questions we touched on in the class review of the exam… I have no idea what _that_ says about my studying, but it’s what we’ve got to work with.
