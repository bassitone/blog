Pleased to present my first "production" programming project: a wrapper for the venerable xDoTool used for, among other things, sending keystrokes to a remote x11 session.  I generally prefer ssh, but I (and the team I'm a part of) end up using x11 forwarding enough that typing out [code]space[/code] among other things was getting to be a pain.  Python 3.5, and very rough at this point, but I think it's about ready to show off.  [Check it out](https://github.com/bassitone/better-xdotool)!
