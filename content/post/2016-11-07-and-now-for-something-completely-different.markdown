Well, kinda.  Most of y'all are probably used to random journal entries by now, but to those of y'all who are new here from and for _A Game Called Murder_, welcome!  I do a bunch of different things on this blog and all that.  A lot of candid talk, and this post is one of those.  Honestly, the writing bit is new for NaNoWriMo, but I think I'm going to keep it.  This year may actually be the year that writing sets in as a hobby for more than one month out of the year.

Anyway, daylight savings time ended.  That was a thing.  I think for once I'm caught up on sleep but who even knows anymore?  Not sure if it was the time change screwing with me or the fact that so far it has been all cloudy and dreary here, but this weekend was a bit rough mentally.  Looking back, I've actually come a long way over the last few years.  It was rough this weekend, sure, but I was able to push through it.

I was strong enough.

I _am_ strong enough.

A few short years ago, that wasn't the case.  Many of y'all know I've been depressed and it's a fight I'll be fighting my entire life (or until the singularity/skynet takeover/whatever scenario you fancy).  It's quite simply a thing that is a part of me and I shouldn't run from.  That I'm able to even embark on these self-improvement projects is testament enough to how far I've come.  I have gone from just trying to survive every day to beginning to build myself into the kind of person I want to be.

It's still a balancing act that I have to take, but one that is growing into the new normal.  So normal that part of me is even wondering why I'm writing this out, about to publish it on my blog where who knows who'll find it.  And yet, it's the post that wants to come out.  I don't hold myself back on this blog.  Really, that's the only way.

NaNoWriMo has taken up most of my non-work, non-school focus, and that'll likely be how it goes through November.  Might possibly do some coding or light sysadmin things, but throwing a couple thousand words out every night is a challenge even for me!  Speaking of, did you notice the new coat of paint I put on here?  It hit me yesterday that y'all might not actually have been able to find things that easily with the old theme, even as much as I was actually satisfied with a WordPress theme for once.  Ah well.  Let's see how long this one lasts.

Wait...damn it!  These 450 words don't count for NaNo, do they?!
