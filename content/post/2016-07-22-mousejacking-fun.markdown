I recently got the chance to play with the results of the awesome research by [Bastille](https://www.mousejack.com/) and the [PoC by phikshun and infamy](https://github.com/insecurityofthings/jackit/).  The tl;dr version (though you really should read the linked resources!) is that many wireless mice and keyboards can serve as a backdoor into a system!  Yes, that includes delivering meterpreter and Powershell Empire, too, as well as more harmless pranks.  I'm still playing with it, but it just highlights for me how truly ridiculous the Internet of Things is going to be within a few years.  It feels to me almost as if those MegaMan Battle Network games were about twenty years early.

I can't wait to find out.
